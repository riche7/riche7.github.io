                    <h2><strong>Projects</strong></h2>
                    <h3>Website Banner</h3>
                    <p>Hello! I’m still here to inform you in every step. What we have here? This still was a project from the boot camp. As you can see, it is a “Website Banner”. I keep doing stuff for bakeries. It seems that it is going to be my new project for this year. Thank you God! I’m going to have a bakery. Wow! As you can see, in this project, there are five pages. I have to tell you that, creating websites requires more pictures, especially for a bakery one.  I enjoyed doing it, especially on placing images, putting background, styling fonts, etc... Contact me for any help on this type.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Home Page</h4>
                    <img src="images/1.png" alt="Home" /> 
                    <p>Here we have the home page. I created it with simple templates. I used the background image in every subpages. I used Canva to do this too. If you are a web designer, you can try it yourself too or you can contact me for any help.
                    </p>
                    <h4>about us</h4>
                    <img src="images/2.png" alt="about us" />
                    <p>Here we have the About us page. I put some iformation about the bakery and I also include some images. I found that images play a great role in creating web pages. I did not include a map yet. Hope this will hel you to have an idea.</p>
                    <h4>Our Products</h4>
                    <img src="images/3.png" alt="Our Products" />
                    <p>The Our Products page, is presenting the different kinds of bakery products. I found it was important to let people know about the products. The images give a sight on the different kinds of the business produtcs. You can try it the same way for you website.</p>
                    <h4>The Media</h4>
                    <img src="images/4.png" alt="The Media" />
                    <p>This part includes details about the activities that bakery doing and its presence in the social media. Social media is also a great tool to help you business gathered customers. Never forget to include them in your website.I did not include lots of stuff there. Maybe later. </p>
                    <h4>contact Us</h4>
                    <img src="images/5.png" alt="Conyacy Us" />
                    <p>The last page is all about the business contact. The same way that the Home page is important for your customer to get infomation on who you are, what you are doing and where you from, it is very important to always include the Contact page. It is there to let people who visit your website to stay in contact with you. Never forget to include it.  </p>
